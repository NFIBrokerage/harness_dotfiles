# HarnessDotfiles

![Actions CI](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/harness_dotfiles/workflows/Actions%20CI/badge.svg)

A harness for a common collection of dotfiles

This is a deprecated harness package we used to use to store common dotfiles
like ASDF's `.tool-versions` file and coveralls configuration. We ended up
moving each of these configurations into more specific harness packages because
we wanting to control Elixir/Erlang versions on a per package level instead of
having "one blessed Elixir/Erlang combination to rule them all." This package
may serve as a pretty minimalistic example of a package to get you going.

The `lib/harness_dotfiles.ex` fulfills the `Harness.Pkg` behavior and serves
as the entrypoint. The `templates/` directory contains the generated files in
EEx format (despite not having a `.eex` extension). This package also has
a `fixture/` that is checked in CI to make sure we don't break consumers of
the package when pushing updates.

As a bit of a side-note, we like using [NimbleOptions] with harness packages
because it makes it easy to document and validate options.
